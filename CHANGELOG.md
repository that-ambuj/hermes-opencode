# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.13.0] - 2026-05-17

### Fixed

- **Gateway notify sink now actually delivers.** `notify._send_gateway`
  previously called `platform_registry.create_adapter(...)`, which
  returned `None` in every observed runtime because the registry's
  `_entries` factory table isn't populated by anything in our load
  path. Real notifications (`agent_done`, `pr_opened`, `cancelled`,
  `serve_down`, heartbeat) silently failed the gateway sink and only
  the dashboard JSONL appended; users with `notify_sinks=["gateway",
  "dashboard"]` thought their DM channel was working when it wasn't.
  The fix: a new `notify._resolve_live_adapter(platform_enum)` helper
  reads `gateway.run._gateway_runner_ref().adapters` directly — the
  already-instantiated adapter dict the gateway uses to send and
  receive messages. `_send_gateway` tries the live runner first, falls
  back to `create_adapter` for CLI / out-of-gateway-process contexts,
  and emits an explicit `"create_adapter returned None ... and no live
  runner found (notify is firing outside the gateway process)"` when
  both fail so the next failure is easy to triage. The `NotifyResult`
  detail now also names which path delivered the message (`live
  runner` vs `create_adapter`).

- **Removed dead `hermes send-message` subprocess fallback** from
  `_gateway_send` in `__init__.py`. `hermes send-message` was never a
  real subcommand (verified against `hermes -h`); the branch only ever
  logged a warning and dropped the echo on the floor. `_gateway_send`
  now resolves the adapter via the same shared
  `notify._resolve_live_adapter` helper as the notify path — one
  adapter-resolution path for the whole plugin.

### Added

- **`/oc test-notify [message ...]` subcommand.** Forces a full
  notify fanout (gateway DM + dashboard + cli) with a synthetic event
  and prints a per-sink `[ok]` / `[FAIL]` line with the failure detail
  for each. Intended for verifying the gateway DM trigger end-to-end
  without waiting for a real agent state transition; also useful for
  debugging future notify regressions. Also wired into the dispatcher,
  the `/oc help` text, and behind the gateway slash-command dispatch
  hook so it works from iMessage / Telegram / Discord / Slack.

### Changed

- `register_command("oc", description=...)` text now mentions `cancel`
  (was stale — listed only `list / attach / questions / doctor`).

## [0.12.1] - 2026-05-17

### Fixed

- **`OpencodeClient.ensure_server` is now thread-safe.** Completes the
  v0.12.0 watchdog feature. The lock + reaper landed in `transport.py`
  but weren't committed alongside the rest of the watchdog code in
  v0.12.0. Added `self._spawn_lock = threading.Lock()` on init; the
  entire spawn sequence in `ensure_server` is now wrapped in the lock,
  re-checks the port after acquiring, and reaps any tracked-but-dead
  `Popen` via `_reap_tracked_spawn` (terminate → 5s wait → kill → 2s
  wait) before starting a fresh process. Without this, tool-handler
  threads (`oc_spawn` on the hermes main thread) and the watchdog
  thread (via `asyncio.to_thread`) could both observe the port closed
  and race-spawn duplicate `opencode serve` processes — exactly the
  zombie-process pattern we saw in `ps aux` earlier today (3 opencode
  servers on different ports during one hermes session).

## [0.12.0] - 2026-05-17

### Added

- **`opencode serve` watchdog loop.** A new background task on the
  plugin's singleton asyncio loop pings `opencode serve` every 15 s. If
  the server was previously seen alive and then becomes unreachable, the
  watchdog attempts up to **5 restarts with exponential backoff**
  (1 s, 2 s, 4 s, 8 s, 16 s before each successive attempt — ~31 s total
  if every attempt fails) via `OpencodeClient.ensure_server`. On
  successful recovery the notification cooldown resets and tool handlers
  resume against the same server URL.
- **Critical alert on all channels when restarts are exhausted.** If all
  5 exponential restart attempts fail, a `serve_down` event fans out to
  every notification sink — `cli`, `dashboard`, and `gateway` —
  regardless of the user's `notify.sinks` config, because a dead opencode
  server stalls every agent. The fanout is throttled to once per 10 min
  while the server stays down; recovery resets the cooldown immediately.
  The event is also appended to `events.log` with `kind=serve_down`,
  `server_url`, and `attempts` metadata so the dashboard's events feed
  and `hermes oco doctor` can surface it.

### Changed

- **`OpencodeClient.ensure_server` is now thread-safe.** A new
  `_spawn_lock` (threading.Lock) guards the spawn region so concurrent
  callers — the synchronous tool handlers running on the hermes main
  thread and the asynchronous watchdog running via `asyncio.to_thread`
  in the bg event-loop — can't both spawn duplicate `opencode serve`
  processes against the same port. Before respawning, any tracked-but-
  dead `Popen` is reaped via `_reap_tracked_spawn` (terminate → 5 s wait
  → kill) so a crashed prior process can't linger as a zombie.

### Internal

- New constants in `event_loop.py`: `SERVE_WATCHDOG_INTERVAL_SEC`,
  `SERVE_RESTART_MAX_ATTEMPTS`, `SERVE_RESTART_BACKOFF_BASE_SEC`,
  `SERVE_DOWN_NOTIFY_COOLDOWN_SEC`, `SERVE_DOWN_NOTIFY_SINKS`.
- New helpers: `_compute_serve_restart_delay(attempt, base)` (pure;
  clamps non-positive attempts to 1), `_serve_watchdog_loop()` (arming +
  detection + recovery + cooldown), `_try_restart_serve_with_backoff()`
  (gated on `auto_spawn_server`), `_build_serve_down_notification()`
  (returns `(title, body, meta)`; tested), and `_notify_serve_down()`.
- `_supervisor` now spawns the watchdog alongside `_pruner_loop`,
  `_heartbeat_loop`, and `_cleanup_loop`; all four are cancelled together
  on `event_loop.stop()`.
- 8 new tests in `test_pure_logic.py` cover the exponential delay
  sequence (1, 2, 4, 8, 16 s), zero/negative-attempt clamping, custom
  bases, the `MAX_ATTEMPTS == 5` invariant, the all-three-sinks fanout
  target, and the `serve_down` notification body (server URL + attempt
  count + metadata).

## [0.12.0] - 2026-05-17

### Added

- **`CANCELLED` phase** (terminal) for tasks wound down without merging.
  Distinct from `KILLED` (which erases the agent record). Cancelled rows
  stay in `agents.json` for audit, render with the `🚫` glyph in
  `/oc list` and the dashboard, carry an optional
  `cancellation_reason`, and are archived after 12 h via the same path
  as DONE.
- **`oc_cancel` tool / `/oc cancel <agent_id> [reason ...]` slash /
  `hermes oco cancel <agent_id> [--reason ...]` CLI.** Runs the full
  cleanup sequence (delete opencode sessions, teardown reviewer
  worktree, run cleanup skill, remove executor worktree) and flips
  phase to `CANCELLED` with the supplied reason. Refuses on
  already-terminal agents (`DONE`, `KILLED`, `CANCELLED`).
- **Auto-cancel on upstream PR closed without merge.**
  `event_loop._phase_pr_open` now branches on
  `pr_state == "CLOSED"` in addition to `"MERGED"`. The agent
  transitions to `CANCELLED` with `reason="PR #N closed without merge"`
  and the cleanup helper runs end-to-end. Latency: at most
  `PR_POLL_SEC = 5 min` between the user closing the PR on GitHub and
  the local agent flipping; `oc_cancel` is the instant manual path.
- **`cancelled` event** added to the default `notify.events.enabled`
  set so users see cancellations on their DM channel.
- **Auto-detected DM channel.** `Config.from_plugin_entry` now scans
  `os.environ` for `<PLATFORM>_HOME_CHANNEL` in priority order
  (`bluebubbles, telegram, discord, slack, teams, google_chat, feishu,
  wecom, line, irc, mattermost, sms, qqbot`) and populates
  `notify_gateway_platform` + `notify_gateway_chat_id` from the first
  match — no plugin-entry config required. When a home channel is
  detected, default `notify.sinks` flips from `["cli", "dashboard"]`
  to `["gateway", "dashboard"]` so notifications land on the user's
  DM by default. Explicit `notify.gateway.platform` or
  `notify.sinks` in the plugin entry always win.
- **`/oc doctor`** now prints `notify discovery` showing where the
  gateway target came from (`explicit`, `env:<VAR>`, or absent when
  unset).
- **Dashboard** renders the `🚫` glyph for CANCELLED with a muted,
  strikethrough phase label.

### Changed

- **`event_loop.TERMINAL_PHASES`** now includes `CANCELLED`.
- **Pruner** archives both `DONE` and `CANCELLED` agents after 12 h.
- **MERGED + CLOSED branches** in `_phase_pr_open` now share a single
  `_cleanup_worktrees(agent, worktree)` helper. The MERGED branch
  behaviour is unchanged.
- **`oc_kill` tool description** clarified to direct users to
  `oc_cancel` when they want to preserve the audit record.

### Internal

- `Agent.cancelled_at: float | None` + `Agent.cancellation_reason: str | None`
  added to the dataclass (migration-tolerant — old rows load with defaults).
- `Config.notify_discovery_source: str | None` records where the gateway
  target was resolved from. Surfaced in `/oc doctor`.
- New helper `config.discover_home_channel() -> tuple[platform, chat_id, source] | None`.
- New helper `event_loop._cleanup_worktrees(agent, worktree)` — shared
  by MERGED and CLOSED branches of `_phase_pr_open`.
- New tool count: 21 (was 20).
- 25 new tests across `test_pure_logic.py`, `test_registries.py`,
  `test_commands.py`, `test_cli.py` cover: CANCELLED round-trip + the
  pruner-archives-CANCELLED rule, `_phase_pr_open` branching on OPEN /
  MERGED / CLOSED, home-channel auto-detection priority + explicit
  override / sinks-override / discovery-source labelling, the
  `/oc cancel` parser and slash handler, the `hermes oco cancel` CLI
  including the already-DONE refusal. 175/175 green.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-05-17

### Added

- **`oc_project_regenerate_cleanup` tool.** Generates (or regenerates)
  ONLY the per-project cleanup skill, leaving the bootstrap skill
  untouched. Useful for projects registered before cleanup-skill support
  landed (v0.6.0 and earlier) where `Project.cleanup_skill` is still
  `None`, or when the bootstrap has been hand-edited and you want a
  fresh cleanup that reverses it without re-running the full bootstrap
  generation. Backed by a new `bootstrap.generate_cleanup_skill(...)`
  helper that reads the existing bootstrap (if any) and the repo, then
  writes only `~/.hermes/skills/hermes-opencode__<abbrev>-cleanup/SKILL.md`
  and updates `Project.cleanup_skill` in the registry.

### Changed

- **Flag renamed to `--archived`.** `/oc list --archived` and
  `hermes oco list --archived` are now the documented form. `--all` and
  `-a` remain accepted as aliases so anyone who picked up the v0.10.0
  hint string keeps working.
- The `no agents tracked` hint when everything visible is archived now
  reads `(use --archived to include archived)`.

### Internal

- `bootstrap.generate_cleanup_skill(client, project, throwaway_worktree, registry)`:
  scoped opencode round-trip that asks for ONLY a
  `CLEANUP_BEGIN/CLEANUP_END` block; handles empty-block no-op case
  (writes a no-op skill rather than skipping registry update); returns
  typed `BootstrapResult` matching the existing surface.
- New tool count: 20 (was 19). `provides_tools` in `plugin.yaml` now
  also lists `oc_output` which was previously omitted.
- 4 new tests in `test_spawn_auto_bootstrap.py` cover: cleanup-only
  generation persisting to registry + writing the SKILL.md file, the
  bootstrap-skill-unchanged invariant, the empty-block no-op path, and
  the missing-block error path.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-05-17

### Added

- **Archived agents.** DONE agents older than 12 h are now marked
  `archived=True` in `agents.json` (still on disk, just hidden) instead of
  being hard-deleted after 4 h. The previous `_archive_done(...)` history
  append is retained for audit; what changes is that the row stays in
  `agents.json` so the dashboard / CLI can still surface it on demand.
- **`/oc list --all`** and **`hermes oco list --all` / `-a`** to include
  archived agents in the listing. Default behaviour hides them. When all
  visible agents are archived, `/oc list` returns a hint that `--all` is
  required.
- **Dashboard archived toggle.** New checkbox in the Opencode Agents
  header (`show archived`) toggles the `?include_archived=1` query string
  on `/api/plugins/hermes-opencode/agents` and on the events WebSocket.
  Archived rows render with a muted `archived` badge next to the agent
  id. The header surfaces the hidden-count when archived items are
  filtered out.
- **Executor-driven PR open** (`reviewer.executor_open_pr`). After
  reviewer LGTM (or cycle exhaustion), the plugin no longer shells out
  to `gh pr create --fill` itself. Instead it sends a structured prompt
  to the executor's existing opencode session asking it to commit any
  pending diff, push the branch, and run `gh pr create` with a concrete
  title + summary; the executor emits a `PR_OPENED: <url>` sentinel line
  that the plugin parses. Falls back to the plugin-driven
  `finalize_and_open_pr(...)` path when extraction fails. Two
  consequences: (a) PR titles + bodies are now written by the agent with
  full task context instead of a slugified agent id + verbatim prompt
  dump, and (b) the PR commit lands under the user's normal git identity
  because the executor's shell tool inherits it.

### Fixed

- **Commits no longer hard-forced to the `hermes-opencode@local` git
  identity.** `reviewer.stage_reviewer_worktree` previously passed
  `-c user.email=hermes-opencode@local -c user.name=hermes-opencode` on
  the pre-review staging commit, which made every PR show the executor's
  attribution as the plugin instead of the user's configured git
  identity. The staging commit now runs without those overrides; if
  git has no user configured it surfaces a typed `GitError` instead of
  silently swapping the author.
- **Ambiguous review verdicts no longer silently loop in `REVIEWING`.**
  When the reviewer emits neither `REVIEW: LGTM` nor
  `REVIEW: REQUESTS_CHANGES`, the classifier returns `ambiguous`;
  previously `_handle_review_text` did nothing in that branch, leaving
  the agent stuck. The same code path that handles `requests_changes`
  now runs for `ambiguous`, with the full reviewer text forwarded to the
  executor and normal cycle accounting applied.
- **Tightened reviewer prompt.** The reviewer is now explicitly required
  to run `git diff origin/<base>...HEAD`, read every changed hunk, and
  reject LGTM on untested behaviour changes, dead code, silently
  swallowed errors, placeholders, or scope creep. Concrete file+line
  citations are mandatory on any non-LGTM verdict. Replaces the prior
  generic prompt that under-specified the bar for LGTM and contributed
  to rubber-stamp reviews on shallow plan-agent passes.
- **`/oc list` PR url visibility.** The PR url (when set) is now on the
  primary line of each agent block instead of a separate continuation
  line tucked under PR_OPEN / DONE. iMessage / Slack / Discord render
  the url as a tap-target without needing to expand the row. The PR
  number-only fallback (`PR #N`) still applies when only `pr_number` is
  known.

### Internal

- `Agent.archived: bool = False` + `Agent.archived_at: float | None`
  added to the dataclass. Old `agents.json` rows missing those keys load
  with the defaults (verified by test
  `test_old_rows_without_archived_field_load_with_default`).
- `event_loop._pruner_loop` now archives instead of deleting; the
  constant `DONE_RETENTION_SEC = 4 * 3600.0` is replaced by
  `ARCHIVE_AFTER_SEC = 12 * 3600.0`.
- `event_loop._phase_committing` calls
  `reviewer.executor_open_pr(...)` first and only falls back to
  `reviewer.finalize_and_open_pr(...)` when no PR url is extracted.
- New helpers in `reviewer.py`: `executor_open_pr_prompt(branch, base)`,
  `parse_pr_opened(text)`, `executor_open_pr(client, agent, base, *, timeout_sec)`.
- 15 new tests across `test_commands.py`, `test_pure_logic.py`, and
  `test_registries.py` covering archived filtering, the `--all` flag,
  PR-url primary-line promotion, `parse_pr_opened` extraction, the
  executor-PR prompt invariants, and the migration-tolerance for old
  agent rows.

## [0.9.1] — 2026-05-17

### Fixed

- **`/oc` slash command now works through the gateway** (iMessage,
  Telegram, Discord, Slack, etc.). The `register_command(...)` call alone
  was sufficient for the CLI dispatch path but the gateway never reached
  the plugin's command handler. Pattern lifted from `eng-task-system`:
  also register a `pre_gateway_dispatch` hook that:
    1. Inspects each incoming gateway message
    2. Returns immediately for anything that isn't `/oc` followed by EOS
       or whitespace (so `/oc-list`, `/oclist`, and unrelated text pass
       straight through)
    3. For `/oc …` messages, calls the existing `make_oc_dispatcher`
       handler and echoes the result back via the channel's adapter
       (in-process gateway runner first, `hermes send-message`
       subprocess as fallback)
    4. Returns `{"action": "skip", "reason": "/oc handled inline"}` so
       the rest of the gateway's command-resolution path doesn't fire
- AGENTS.md updated with a `gateway slash-command dispatch` section
  documenting the dual-registration requirement so future contributors
  know to register both `ctx.register_command` AND a
  `pre_gateway_dispatch` filter when adding new slash commands.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-05-17

### Added

- **`/oc doctor` slash command** — single-message plugin health report.
  Lists plugin version, state directory, opencode server url, bg event-
  loop liveness, project / agent / pending counts, notify sink + gateway
  target + events config, heartbeat schedule, binary presence (opencode,
  gh, git, bun), Python dep presence (httpx, httpx-sse, yaml), state-file
  sizes, and a tail of the last few `events.log` entries. Designed to
  produce a single paste-able report for triaging.
- **Cleanup loop running every 12 hours.** New `_cleanup_loop` task on
  the bg event-loop performs four housekeeping passes:
  - truncate `events.log` to the last 5000 lines
  - truncate `notifications.jsonl` to the last 1000 lines
  - drop `history.jsonl` entries older than 30 days (based on
    `archived_at` / `done_at`)
  - remove orphan worktrees under `wt/` whose name no longer matches any
    live agent's filesystem slug
- **Per-project cleanup skill, auto-generated alongside bootstrap.** When
  `bootstrap.generate_bootstrap_skill` runs for the first time on a new
  project it now asks the opencode introspection session to emit BOTH a
  bootstrap block AND a matching cleanup block that inverses the
  bootstrap's side effects (stop docker compose services started by
  bootstrap, drop ephemeral databases, remove generated `.env` files,
  etc.). The cleanup script is written to
  `~/.hermes/skills/hermes-opencode:<abbrev>-cleanup/SKILL.md` and the
  cleanup-skill reference is stored on the project record as
  `cleanup_skill`. If the introspection session emits an empty cleanup
  block (nothing worth reversing), no cleanup skill is written and the
  field stays `None`.
- **Cleanup skill runs before worktree removal** in two places:
  - `_phase_pr_open` when the PR merges and the agent transitions to
    `DONE`. Failure of the cleanup is logged but doesn't block worktree
    removal — teardown is best-effort.
  - `oc_kill` when `remove_worktree=True`. Cleanup failure is recorded
    in the tool result's `errors` field but doesn't block teardown.

### Changed

- **`/oc list` output reformatted from a column-aligned ASCII table to
  flow-oriented per-agent lines** — works equally well in CLI, iMessage,
  Slack, and Discord (none of which render fixed-width ASCII tables
  consistently). Pattern lifted from `eng-task-system`:
    `<glyph> <agent_id> · <PHASE> · <age> [· PR #N]`
  with an indented continuation line for `FAILED` (error), `PR_OPEN`
  (url), and `DONE` (merged + url). Phase glyphs:
  ▶ executing · ⏸ idle · 🔎 reviewing · 💾 committing · 🔗 PR open ·
  ✓ done · ✗ failed · 🛑 killed.

### Notes

- The cleanup skill is only AUTO-generated when the plugin spawns the
  introspection session itself (i.e. on first `oc_spawn` for a project
  with no `bootstrap_skill`). Projects whose bootstrap skill was
  configured manually have `cleanup_skill=None` until you either
  (a) run `oc_project_regenerate_bootstrap` (which regenerates both),
  or (b) manually write
  `~/.hermes/skills/hermes-opencode:<abbrev>-cleanup/SKILL.md` and call
  `oc_project_set_repo_path` or edit `projects.json` to set the field.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-05-17

### Changed (breaking)

- **Project renamed from `opencode-orchestrator` to `hermes-opencode`.**
  Matches the convention used by other hermes plugins (`hermes-achievements`,
  `hermes-claude-auth`, etc.) and makes the install command read naturally:

      hermes plugins install that-ambuj/hermes-opencode

  All `opencode-orchestrator` references in code, manifests, JSON / YAML
  config keys, dashboard mount paths, install symlink targets, and skill
  namespaces become `hermes-opencode` (kebab) or `hermes_opencode` (snake).
  Tool prefixes (`oc_*`), slash command (`/oc`), and CLI subcommand
  (`hermes oco`) stay unchanged — those refer to *opencode* (the agent we
  drive), not the plugin name.

  **Migration for existing installs:**

      mv ~/.hermes/plugins/opencode-orchestrator ~/.hermes/plugins/hermes-opencode

  Then in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`, rename the key:

      plugins:
        entries:
          opencode-orchestrator:  →  hermes-opencode:
            …

  And replace `plugins.enabled: [opencode-orchestrator]` with
  `[hermes-opencode]`. The GitHub repo was renamed via `gh repo rename`
  which keeps redirects, so old install URLs continue to resolve.

### Cleaned up

- README "Roadmap" section replaced with a "Status" table marking each
  shipped surface ✓ against the release it landed in. The intro paragraph
  now opens with a one-line elevator pitch and the canonical
  `hermes plugins install …` snippet.
- README "Requirements" section expanded to match the omo plugin's
  table-with-glyphs format: hermes-agent, opencode binary, `gh` CLI,
  git ≥ 2.40, Python deps. Each item links to its source.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-05-17

### Changed (breaking)

- **Slash commands consolidated to a single `/oc` with subcommands.** The
  prior `/oc-list`, `/oc-attach`, `/oc-questions` commands are gone.
  Equivalents:
    `/oc-list`         →  `/oc list`
    `/oc-attach …`     →  `/oc attach …`
    `/oc-questions`    →  `/oc questions`
  Running `/oc` with no args (or `/oc help` / `/oc --help`) prints a help
  message listing all subcommands. Unknown subcommands surface the help
  inline. Subcommand names are case-insensitive.

  Rationale: the user-facing CLI subcommand is already `hermes oco
  {list,attach,kill,projects}` and matching the slash-command shape to it
  is the natural pattern. Single registration also means just one slot in
  `hermes plugins list`'s slash-command count.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-05-17

### Added

- **Event-based notifications** on key state-machine transitions, not just
  the hourly heartbeat. New event kinds:
  - `pr_opened` — fires when an agent transitions to `PR_OPEN` with the PR
    URL + branch in the body.
  - `done` — fires when the PR merges and the agent transitions to `DONE`.
  - `failed` — fires on any `FAILED` transition with the captured
    `last_error`.
  - `awaiting_human` — fires when a new pending `/question` is detected
    for an agent (deduped per question_id so we don't replay on each
    polling tick).
  - `review_started` — fires when the reviewer session spawns on the
    sister worktree.
  Each event is gated by `notify.events.enabled` in the plugin config
  (default: all five kinds enabled). Events fan out to the same sinks as
  the heartbeat (`cli` / `gateway` / `dashboard`) and ALSO get logged
  unconditionally to `~/.hermes/plugins/hermes-opencode/events.log`
  as newline-delimited JSON for diagnostics.
- **`events.log` diagnostic sink** at
  `~/.hermes/plugins/hermes-opencode/events.log`. Every event the
  plugin emits is appended regardless of which user-facing sinks are
  configured, so `tail -f` on it gives a complete view even when no
  gateway DM target is set up yet. Each line is JSON:
  `{ts, kind, agent_id, project, phase, pr_url, title, body}`.

### Fixed

- **Heartbeat scheduler no longer dies silently** when `_runtime` is
  briefly `None` at startup. Previously the `_heartbeat_loop` coro did
  `if _runtime is None: return`, exiting forever if it raced the
  `start(runtime)` setter. Now it retries every 10 s until `_runtime` is
  populated. Same retry-instead-of-return guard added to `_pruner_loop`.
- **Heartbeat scheduler now logs at INFO** when it computes the next
  fire time and when it actually fires (sink results inline). Grep
  `~/.hermes/logs/agent.log` for `heartbeat:` to debug.

### Notes

- If you weren't seeing heartbeats before, set
  `oc_set_notify_target(platform="telegram", chat_id="...")` (or your
  preferred platform/chat_id) so the gateway sink has a target. The CLI
  sink only works inside an active interactive `hermes chat` session;
  the dashboard sink writes to `notifications.jsonl` (visible in the
  dashboard tab). With nothing configured the new `events.log` file
  still captures everything for `tail -f` debugging.

## [0.5.1] — 2026-05-17

### Fixed

- **`gh pr create` finding an existing PR is no longer fatal.** When the
  branch already has an open PR, `gh pr create` exits non-zero with stderr
  like `a pull request for branch "..." into branch "main" already exists:
  <url>`. Previously the orchestrator treated this as a `PrError` and
  transitioned the agent to `FAILED` even though the PR demonstrably
  existed. Now `pr.open_pr` parses the URL out of the gh output via a new
  `_existing_pr_from_output` helper, calls `pr_state` to load the live PR
  status, and returns a `PrInfo` as if `gh pr create` had succeeded. If
  the follow-up `pr_state` call itself flakes (rate-limited `gh pr view`,
  etc.), it falls back to `state="OPEN", merged_at=None` rather than
  failing the agent — the whole point of the recovery is that the PR
  demonstrably exists. Covered by `tests/test_pr.py`.

### Rebased

- Rebased onto `0.5.0` (had originally branched off PR #2 / `0.3.5` and
  proposed `0.3.6`). Patch bump to `0.5.1` since main shipped both PR #1
  (`0.4.0`) and PR #2 (`0.5.0`) in the meantime. The PR #2-derived
  changes that this branch carried (cli.py, commands.py, slash command
  registrations, etc.) are dropped — they're already in `0.5.0`. Only
  the focused `gh pr create` recovery fix remains.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-05-17

### Added

- **Three slash commands** for ops without going through the LLM:
  - `/oc-list` — pretty table of all tracked agents (agent_id, project,
    branch, phase, pr, age).
  - `/oc-attach <agent_id> [--lines N]` — print the last N lines of an
    agent's transcript (pulled via `client.get_messages`; future SSE-buffer
    integration noted).
  - `/oc-questions` — list all pending opencode questions across active
    agents, formatted with structured options when present.
- **`hermes oco` CLI subcommand** for shell-level driving outside a chat
  session: `oco list`, `oco status [agent_id] [--json]`,
  `oco attach <agent_id> [--lines N]`, `oco kill <agent_id> [--force]`,
  `oco projects`. Each subcommand instantiates `Runtime` from disk-only
  state so it works with no in-process event loop.
- **`config.load_entry_config()`** extracted from `__init__.py` so both
  `__init__.py` (in-session) and `cli.py` (out-of-session) can read the
  same `plugins.entries.hermes-opencode` config without a circular
  import.

### Rebased

- Rebased onto `0.4.0` (had originally branched off `0.3.4` and proposed
  `0.3.5`). Minor bump to `0.5.0` since the new surfaces are user-facing
  features rather than fixes.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-05-17

### Added

- **Configurable review cycles.** New `review.max_cycles` config (default `1`)
  controls how many automatic address-and-rereview rounds the executor will
  go through before transitioning straight to `COMMITTING`. Manual
  `oc_review_again` calls also bump the per-agent `review_cycle_count` so the
  cap is tracked across user-initiated retries.
- **Auto bootstrap-skill generation on first spawn.** When `oc_spawn` is
  called for a project that has no `bootstrap_skill` yet, the plugin now
  spins up a one-shot opencode introspection session in a throwaway worktree
  and generates a `SKILL.md` before the executor session starts. Gated by
  `bootstrap.auto_on_first_spawn` (default `true`).
- **`oc_output` tool + live SSE consumer.** A background per-agent task
  subscribes to opencode's `GET /event` stream and accumulates
  `message.part.delta` / `message.part.updated` text payloads into an
  in-memory buffer. The new `oc_output` tool returns the buffered text (or
  falls back to a `/message` pull when empty), with an optional `clear` flag
  to reset the buffer after read. Tool count: 18 → 19.
- **Dashboard live-events WebSocket.** New `/events` endpoint on the
  dashboard router pushes an initial snapshot plus `agents` / `heartbeat`
  deltas based on `agents.json` / `notifications.jsonl` mtime changes. The
  React bundle now opens the WebSocket on mount, falls back to the existing
  5s poll if the socket errors or closes within 5s, and shows a `ws` /
  `poll` transport indicator in the header.
- **PR title cleanup.** PR titles are now derived from the agent's task slug
  via `_pr_title_from_agent_id` — collision suffixes (`-2`, `-3`, …) are
  stripped, kebab is replaced with spaces, and the result is capitalized.
  The pre-review staging commit also uses the cleaned title
  (`chore: <title>` instead of `[wip] checkpoint before review`).

### Rebased

- Rebased on top of `0.3.4` (had originally branched off `0.3.1`). The PR
  originally hand-edited `dashboard/dist/index.js`; per the convention
  documented in `AGENTS.md`, those changes were translated into
  `dashboard/src/index.jsx` and `dist/index.js` was regenerated via
  `bun run build`. The `make_spawn` regression of the 0.3.2 fix
  (`send_message` → `send_message_async`) was also corrected before merge.

## [0.3.4] — 2026-05-17

### Added

- **Dashboard agent detail modal.** Click any agent row in the dashboard to
  open a centered detail view showing project, branch, session id, worktree
  path, reviewer session/worktree (if applicable), review cycle count, PR
  url + number + merged-at, done-at, last error, and the initial prompt in
  a scrollable code block. Dismiss with Esc or by clicking the backdrop.
  Clickable rows have a hover highlight; the PR link cell stops propagation
  so clicking the PR link doesn't also open the modal.
- **`AGENTS.md`** at the repo root: developer notes for AI agents working
  on the plugin. Covers plugin runtime contract, tool-schema convention
  (the 0.3.0 → 0.3.1 fix), sync vs async opencode endpoints (the 0.3.1 →
  0.3.2 fix), reviewer worktree isolation, atomic state writes, dashboard
  build workflow, CSS variable convention (the 0.3.2 → 0.3.3 fix), and a
  blocking-anti-patterns section.

## [0.3.3] — 2026-05-17

### Fixed

- **Dashboard text was invisible** against the host theme. CSS used variable
  names that don't exist in hermes' dashboard (`--foreground`, `--muted`,
  `--border`); the fallback colors I shipped (`#ddd`, `#888`) collided with
  whatever the host theme rendered, so text was only visible during selection.
  Now uses the actual host variables: `--color-foreground`,
  `--color-muted-foreground`, `--color-border`, `--color-card`,
  `--color-primary`, `--color-ring`, `--font-mono`. Matches the convention
  used by the bundled `hermes-achievements` dashboard plugin.

### Added

- **Dashboard refresh button** in the header row. Manually triggers a fetch
  in addition to the 5s auto-poll; spins while in-flight; shows "updated Ns
  ago" relative timestamp.
- **Proper React source + build pipeline.** Previously `dashboard/dist/index.js`
  was hand-edited vanilla `React.createElement` calls (build artifact masquerading
  as source). Now:
    - `dashboard/src/index.jsx` is the canonical source (proper JSX)
    - `dashboard/package.json` declares esbuild as a devDep and exposes
      `bun run build` (or `npm run build`) which compiles `src/index.jsx` →
      `dist/index.js` using `--jsx-factory=React.createElement
      --jsx-fragment=React.Fragment --format=iife`
    - `dashboard/dist/` is still committed (hermes loads it at runtime)
  Future dashboard work edits `src/`; `dist/` is regenerated.

## [0.3.2] — 2026-05-17

### Fixed

- **`oc_spawn` no longer blocks the hermes main session.** Previously the
  initial prompt was sent via `POST /session/:id/message`, which streams the
  full assistant turn inline before returning — blocking the hermes tool
  handler (and therefore the user's chat) for the entire first turn (often
  30 s – several minutes for non-trivial tasks). Now uses
  `POST /session/:id/prompt_async`, which queues the work and returns
  immediately. The plugin's bg event-loop picks up state transitions via the
  existing polling / SSE channels.
  Trade-off: the return value no longer carries `first_turn_assistant_text`
  or `first_turn_finish`. Use `oc_wait` + `oc_status` (or the upcoming
  `oc_output` from v0.4) to inspect the first turn's result.
  General rule for future tool handlers: any code path called synchronously
  by a hermes tool dispatcher must use non-blocking opencode endpoints. Code
  inside `event_loop._phase_*` may use blocking endpoints freely.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-05-17

### Fixed

- **Tool schemas now expose `description` and `parameters` to the LLM.** The
  original 0.3.0 release passed descriptions as a `register_tool(description=...)`
  kwarg, which hermes' registry silently drops. Schemas also lacked the
  `parameters` wrapper required by the OpenAI tool-call format. As a result the
  LLM was seeing tools by name only with empty descriptions and ill-formed
  parameter shapes. All 18 tool schemas now embed `name` + `description` +
  `parameters` inline per the convention used by `plugins/spotify/tools.py`.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-17

Initial public release. End-to-end orchestration of multiple opencode agents in
git worktrees, driven from a hermes-agent session.

### Added

- **Project registry** (`oc_project_add`, `oc_project_list`, `oc_project_show`,
  `oc_project_remove`, `oc_project_set_repo_path`,
  `oc_project_regenerate_bootstrap`). Project keys derived from
  `git remote.origin.url`; abbreviations auto-derived from kebab-segments.
- **Spawn / drive surface** (`oc_spawn`, `oc_send`, `oc_status`, `oc_wait`,
  `oc_kill`). Initial prompts are forwarded to opencode **verbatim**.
- **Agent naming**: `<abbrev>/<task>` ≤ 20 chars, with collision-aware
  numeric suffixes that trim the task slug to fit. Filesystem encoding via
  `/` → `__`.
- **State machine**: per-agent lifecycle CREATED → BOOTSTRAPPING → EXECUTING →
  IDLE_TASK_COMPLETE → REVIEW_SPAWNING → REVIEWING → REVIEW_DELIVERED →
  EXECUTOR_ADDRESSING → IDLE_REVIEW_ADDRESSED → COMMITTING → PR_OPEN → DONE
  (plus FAILED / KILLED). Driven by a singleton background asyncio loop.
- **Reviewer cycle** (`oc_review_now`, `oc_review_again`, `oc_skip_review`):
  reviewer runs in a **separate git worktree** (`<wt>.review/`) with
  opencode's `plan` agent to enforce read-only review. `REVIEW: LGTM` /
  `REVIEW: REQUESTS_CHANGES` tokens drive the classifier.
- **PR opener + merge poller**: `gh pr create --fill` after review;
  `gh pr view` polled every 5 min; agents auto-transition to DONE on merge.
- **Bootstrap subsystem**: shell-out of the project's bootstrap skill bash
  block, with **automatic opencode-driven recovery** on failure. Recovery
  session can also write back an updated skill if it changes the procedure.
- **Skill generation** (`oc_project_regenerate_bootstrap`): spawns a
  short-lived opencode `build` session to introspect a repo and emit
  `SKILL.md` with a fenced bash block delimited by `BOOTSTRAP_BEGIN` /
  `BOOTSTRAP_END`.
- **Question routing** via `pre_llm_call` hook: pending opencode
  questions are injected into the user message as ephemeral context so
  hermes' own LLM can decide whether to call `oc_answer` with the user's
  verbatim reply.
- **`oc_answer` tool**: replies to `/question` entries with verbatim user
  text or structured option labels; can also reject.
- **`oc_pr_status`**: live `gh pr view` for a specific agent's PR.
- **Heartbeat scheduler** (`oc_heartbeat_send_now`, `oc_set_notify_target`):
  top-of-hour reports with TZ-aware day window (`HERMES_TIMEZONE` →
  `timezone` in config.yaml → system tz). Unconditional inside
  `unconditional_hours` (default `[9, 23]`); otherwise only when there are
  pending tasks.
- **Notify fanout** (CLI `inject_message` + gateway DM + dashboard JSONL):
  each sink is opt-in via plugin config; gateway DM uses the verified
  `load_gateway_config()` + `platform_registry.create_adapter()` +
  `model_tools._run_async()` pattern.
- **Retention pruner**: DONE agents drop off the visible list 4h after
  merge, with a forensic archive at `history.jsonl`.
- **Dashboard tab** (`/opencode-agents`): FastAPI router exposing 8
  read-only endpoints (`/health`, `/agents`, `/agents/{id}`, `/projects`,
  `/projects/{label}`, `/heartbeats`, `/history`, `/`) + vanilla-JS React
  bundle using `window.__HERMES_PLUGIN_SDK__` + auth via
  `X-Hermes-Session-Token`.
- **Phase-0 transport spike** at `scripts/phase0_opencode_spike.py` and
  **Phase-1 round-trip smoke** at `scripts/phase1_smoke.py`. Both run via
  `uv run` with inline PEP-723 deps.

### Tested

- Phase-0 spike: 10/10 HTTP contracts against a real `opencode serve`
- Phase-1 smoke: 16/16 steps end-to-end (project_add → spawn → wait →
  send → kill round trip with real opencode)
- Plugin reload: 18 tools / 3 hooks registered through hermes
  `PluginManager` with `error=None`
- Heartbeat smoke: dashboard sink writes formatted JSONL
- Dashboard router smoke: all 8 endpoints return expected payloads

### Notes

- Real executor → reviewer → PR cycle requires `gh auth login` plus a
  writable git remote. The state-machine plumbing is wired and verified
  but full end-to-end PR opening is out of scope for the initial release
  smoke test.
- opencode silently resolves the requested `agent` (e.g. `"build"`) to
  the active OMO/oh-my-openagent profile (e.g. `"Sisyphus - Ultraworker"`)
  when oh-my-openagent is installed. The plugin's executor/reviewer
  distinction lives in the plugin's `agent_id` layer and is unaffected.
